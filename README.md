# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

Matches page (filter by round)

When user selects a round: /fixtures?league&season&round.

Live pulse (matchday syncing)

Every 1â€“3 min around kickoffs:

/fixtures?date=YYYY-MM-DD to pull todayâ€™s fixtures for your 6 leagues, then

If you need richer UI for a visible match card, call events/lineups/players for those fixtureIds only.

Finalize + scoring

Keep polling todayâ€™s fixtures until status becomes FT/AET/PEN (from /fixtures?...).

Once finished, mark predictions and compute points (your Edge Function).

If you need a cleanup pass, you can refetch by ids (batches of 20) to guarantee final stats.
